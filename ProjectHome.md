A POS system designed as a web app that allows for power, flexibility, as well as the often-overlooked usability. Having worked in retail, as many have, I feel like I know what would benefit cashiers the most. At the spirit of this project is Javascript, which will be used to make easy-to-use features that are quick (nobody likes a backed up line of impatient customers), intuitive, and helpful. As this will be a web-based app, it may not be practical for stores running slow thin clients connected to a server 5 states away, as in the case of my store. It may turn out that this software is better for small business owners who conduct business on their own PCs. This is my first real project attempt, and I'm just hoping to learn as I go along.
